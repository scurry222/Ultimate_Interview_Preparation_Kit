// Problem statement #

// The task here is to implement the builder pattern to create an assignment. Each assignment is of a subject: it has a level, which means it is either easy, medium, or hard. It also has a due date. The announcement function given to you displays all this information. You have to figure out where to put this functionâ€™s definition and how to build the assignment step-by-step.

// Input #
// The provided partial code

// Output #
// Complete implementation of the code and the result after calling the announcement method

// Sample input #
// mathAssignment.announcement(); 
// Sample output #
// "Your Math assignment is: Hard. It is due on 12th June, 2020."
