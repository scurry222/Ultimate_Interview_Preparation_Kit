// Problem statement #
// In this challenge, you have to implement a Ninja fighting game using the prototype pattern.

// You have already been given the Ninja constructor function, which will be used to create a ninja object. A ninja should have the following properties:

// name

// points

// The points are set to 100 by default upon the instantiation of a Ninja object.

// A ninja can pull the following moves in a fight:

// punch: ninjas points reduce by 20 if they get a punch

// kick: ninjas points reduce by 50 if they get a kick

// A ninja can only kick or punch the other ninja if the following conditions are met:

// The other ninja’s points are greater than 0.

// The points of the ninja himself are also greater than 0.

// If the two conditions above are met, you should return the points of the other ninja as follows:

// `{other ninja's "name"} points are {other ninja's "points"}`
// If the conditions are not met, you should return the following if a punch was attempted:

// `Can't punch {other ninja's name}`
// And the following if a kick was attempted:

// `Can't kick {other ninja's name}`
// Input #
// Two ninjas fighting

// Output #
// The points of the ninja after being hit or the “Can’t kick/punch” message

// Sample input #
// var ninja1 = new Ninja('Ninja1')
// var ninja2 = new Ninja('Ninja2')
 
// ninja1.kick(ninja2)
// ninja2.punch(ninja1)
// ninja1.kick(ninja2) 
// ninja1.punch(ninja2) 
// ninja2.kick(ninja1)
// Sample output #
// "Ninja2's points are 50"    
// "Ninja1's points are 80"    
// "Ninja2's points are 0"
// "Can't punch Ninja2"
// "Can't kick Ninja1"

    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.points = 100;

Ninja.prototype.punch = (otherNinja) => {
    if (otherNinja.points > 0 && this.points > 0) {
        otherNinja.points -= 20;
        return `${otherNinja.name} points are ${otherNinja.points}`
    }
    else return `Can't punch ${otherNinja.name}`
}

Ninja.prototype.kick = (otherNinja) => {
    if (otherNinja.points > 0 && this.points > 0) {
        otherNinja.points -= 50
        return `${otherNinja.name} points are ${otherNinja.points}`
    }
    else return `Can't kick ${otherNinja.name}`
}

var ninja1 = new Ninja('Ninja1')
var ninja2 = new Ninja('Ninja2')

console.log(`\n${ninja1.name} VS. ${ninja2.name}\n`)

console.log(ninja2.punch(ninja1))
console.log(ninja1.kick(ninja2))
console.log(ninja1.punch(ninja2)) 
console.log(ninja2.kick(ninja1))
