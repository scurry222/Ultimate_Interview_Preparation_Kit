// Problem statement #
// In this challenge, you need to implement the visitor pattern to separate Rock music from the other genres of music by creating a separate playlist. You need to implement the RockMusicVisitor class for this purpose. As you can see, it contains the visit method, which should return the rock music playlist.

// Note: the rock music playlist only needs to contain the names of the songs, not the entire Song object.

// Next, you need to implement a Song class. A Song object will have the following properties: name and genre. You also need to define the two functions: getName and getGenre.

// Finally, you need to implement the MusicLibrary class. It should store a list of all the songs, regardless of the genres. You need to implement the addSong function to add a song and accept function to allow the RockMusicVisitor to visit the music library.

// Input #
// The accept function is called with RockMusicVisitor as a parameter

// Output #
// A playlist containing names of all the rock songs from the library is returned

// Sample input #
// var rockMusicVisitor = new RockMusicVisitor()
// var song1 = new Song("Bohemian Rhapsody","Rock")
// var song2 = new Song("Stairway to Heaven","Rock")
// var song3 = new Song("Oops I did it again", "Pop")
// var song4 = new Song("Crazy", "Country")
// var musicLibrary = new MusicLibrary()
// musicLibrary.addSong(song1)
// musicLibrary.addSong(song2)
// musicLibrary.addSong(song3)
// musicLibrary.addSong(song4)
// console.log(musicLibrary.accept(rockMusicVisitor))
// Sample output #
// ["Bohemian Rhapsody","Stairway to Heaven"]

            index++
         }
